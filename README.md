Bring the Boys Home mod for Total War: Warhammer III.

## Introduction

Approved port of Jadawin's [Bring the Boys Home](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2619922901) for
Warhammer II.

This mod introduces a new feature to the game: war exhaustion. This value, based on the duration of the war and on how
good is it going for the faction, is used to force AI to ask for peace once it has passed a threshold. This fixes a
classic problem with the game where the AI will never ask for help even if it is on a serious disadvantage.

Notable changes introduced from the original Jadawin version include AI to AI peace treaties, extended configuration via
Mod Configuration Tool and automatic support for support for DLC and mod races and factions. Performance and
optimization has also been improved.
